- Mappings selection
  - Remove deobfuscation from NEC
- Crashalytics?
- 'Copy Link' button
  - Link expiry date
- Mobile support: 
  - Layout
  - Share button
- Light mode support
- Authentication solution
  - Allow crash log expiry
- Improve 'Mods' panel
  - Click each mod to reach their website
  - Button to create new issue if github issues is available
  - Improve visibility of 'causing mod' to increase the chance an issue will be made
- Crash discussion
  - Make sure crashes are easily searchable in Google
  - Built-in crash search system (so you can search for an exception and see other people getting it)
  - find some solution for secret info getting released, maybe make crashes private by default and have a button to make them public
  - Add a system for a 'solution' to be posted on the crash (e.g. update to version X, remove mod Y).
- 'Click to copy'
  - Crash context
  - Crash title
  - Entire stack trace (copying will give you the raw trace)
  - Trace line
  - Trace title
  - Mod
  - Entire section
  - Section detail
- Configurable UI
- Button to show raw log
- Explore crashes
- Add 'upload to crashy' to forge init crash screen
- Dynamic meta tags https://crashy.net/R0AyHRMRXcfmeOC5BCDf
- Expose and document API
- 'New Crash' button (maybe home and 'new crash' will be seperated in the future)
- Parse vanilla crashes
- When verifying fails, add a button 'report failure' to automatically Log failures in crash report parsing, so we can identify ourselves more crashes that are not being parsed correctly. 
- Stricter verifying to find cases where verifying succeeds but crash log looks completely wrong, 
possible by checking strings exist when skipping them. Because that is slower maybe add a 'strict' flag that is only used on the server.
- Nicer Mods screen:
  - Group mods by parent (i.e. 30 fabric api mods shouldn't obscure the list)
  - Make suspected mods more prominent, and explain why they were blamed (in the future it could be mixins)
  - Add something in the main screen that makes suspected mods more discoverable
- Log failures in crash report parsing for decently large reports, so we can identify ourselves more crashes that are not being parsed correctly. 
- When a failure happens, we always log the exception itself, with optionally logging the entire crash report. 
- Stricter verifying to find cases where verifying succeeds but crash log looks completely wrong, 
possible by checking strings exist when skipping them. Because that is slower maybe add a 'strict' flag that is only used on the server.
- Suggest fixes. For example, when a mod is blamed, suggest updating it (maybe even somehow detect it has an update)
- Pay a flat amount to save a crash report forever.
